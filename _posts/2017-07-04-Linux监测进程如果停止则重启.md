web应用相关服务未知原因停止，需要做监控，如果停止的话则重启.

我们采用shell+crontab定时任务的方式

##### shell代码如下：

进程包括mysqld,mongod,redis,memcached,nginx,gunicorn

```shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "checking for active mysqld process"
COUNT=`ps ax | grep mysqld | grep -v grep | grep -v exam_system_service_check.sh | wc -l` # see how many are running
echo "there are $COUNT mysqld related processes running";
if [ $COUNT -eq 0 ] 
then
    echo "no mysqld processes running, restarting process"
    /usr/sbin/service mysqld stop  # prevent from piling up, if by some unforeseen reason there are already processes running
    /usr/sbin/service mysqld start
fi

echo "checking for active mongod process"
COUNT=`ps ax | grep mongod | grep -v grep | grep -v exam_system_service_check.sh | wc -l` # see how many are running
echo "there are $COUNT mongod related processes running";
if [ $COUNT -eq 0 ] 
then
    echo "no mongod processes running, restarting process"
    killall mongod  # prevent from piling up, if by some unforeseen reason there are already processes running
    /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
fi

echo "checking for active redis process"
COUNT=`ps ax | grep redis | grep -v grep | grep -v exam_system_service_check.sh | wc -l` # see how many are running
echo "there are $COUNT redis related processes running";
if [ $COUNT -eq 0 ] 
then
    echo "no redis processes running, restarting process"
    killall redis-server  # prevent from piling up, if by some unforeseen reason there are already processes running
    /usr/local/redis-3.2.6/src/redis-server /etc/redis.conf
fi

echo "checking for active memcached process"
COUNT=`ps ax | grep memcached | grep -v grep | grep -v exam_system_service_check.sh | wc -l` # see how many are running
echo "there are $COUNT memcached related processes running";
if [ $COUNT -eq 0 ] 
then
    echo "no memcached processes running, restarting process"
    killall memcached  # prevent from piling up, if by some unforeseen reason there are already processes running
    memcached -u root -d -m 1024 -l 127.0.0.1 -p 11211
fi

echo "checking for active nginx process"
COUNT=`ps ax | grep nginx | grep -v grep | grep -v exam_system_service_check.sh | wc -l` # see how many are running
echo "there are $COUNT nginx related processes running";
if [ $COUNT -eq 0 ] 
then
    echo "no nginx processes running, restarting process"
    killall nginx  # prevent from piling up, if by some unforeseen reason there are already processes running
    /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx
fi

echo "checking for active gunicorn process"
COUNT=`ps ax | grep gunicorn | grep -v grep | grep -v exam_system_service_check.sh | wc -l` # see how many are running
echo "there are $COUNT gunicorn related processes running";
if [ $COUNT -eq 0 ] 
then
    echo "no gunicorn processes running, restarting process"
    pkill gunicorn  # prevent from piling up, if by some unforeseen reason there are already processes running
    cd /home/work/ksxing && sh run.sh
fi
```

##### crontab定时任务

讲上面的文件保存为`/etc/cron.d/exam_system_service_check.sh`

```shell
# 编辑定时任务
$ crontab -e
```

我们设置5分钟执行一次

```shell
*/5 * * * * sh /etc/cron.d/exam_system_service_check.sh
```
